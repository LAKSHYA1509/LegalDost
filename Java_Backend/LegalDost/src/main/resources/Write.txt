Why we make Service class?
Service class is used to encapsulate the business logic of an application. It acts as an interface between the presentation layer and the data access layer. The service class is responsible for performing complex operations, such as data validation, business rules, and data manipulation.
--> Optional in UserService used to?
Ans- The Optional class is often used to handle situations where a user object may or may not be present. This could be due to various reasons such as the user not being found in the database, or theuser not being authenticated.


Don't make yourself fool to SQL DATABASE...
problem was not in post or authenticate but actually problem same data ki re-entry thi.
New Data se login hota hai
Ya to new data banao and usse kaam karo
purana signup karne se database conflict hota hai
That's why always make new data only

   Change in plan:-
   Integrating Thymeleaf in document data forward is indeed difficult as of now

   Then i guess, Moving to javascript is a smart choice
   Hence, we will make documents by javascript
