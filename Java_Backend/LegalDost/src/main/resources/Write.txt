Why we make Service class?
Service class is used to encapsulate the business logic of an application. It acts as an interface between the presentation layer and the data access layer. The service class is responsible for performing complex operations, such as data validation, business rules, and data manipulation.
--> Optional in UserService used to?
Ans- The Optional class is often used to handle situations where a user object may or may not be present. This could be due to various reasons such as the user not being found in the database, or theuser not being authenticated.
